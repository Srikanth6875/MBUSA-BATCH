This isn't just another luxury sedan this is AMG territory, where performance credentials meet daily-driver sophistication.The C 43 AMG represents the sweet spot in Mercedes-AMG's lineup. That turbocharged I4 engine delivers heart-pounding acceleration that transforms every on-ramp into an event, yet somehow maintains a civilized 20/28 MPG for your everyday reality. The 4MATIC all-wheel-drive system channels that power with surgical precision, providing grip that inspires confidence whether you're attacking back roads or navigating winter weather.Let's talk about what AMG really means: This isn't cosmetic theatrics.
